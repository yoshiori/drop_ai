        <section id="installation">
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>To integrate PyMath into your system, ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher. Installation is as simple as synchronizing with our central repository via pip. Open your terminal interface and execute the following command:</p>
            <pre><code>
# Installation command for PyMath
pip install pymath-lib # Assuming 'pymath-lib' is the package name on PyPI
            </code></pre>
            <p>For developmental missions or to contribute to the PyMath continuum, clone our repository from GitHub:
            <pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/[ACTUAL_ORG_OR_USER]/pymath.git
cd pymath
python setup.py install
            </code></pre>
            Ensure all dependencies are assimilated by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` if applicable.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usage">
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>Engage PyMath's capabilities by importing the desired modules into your Python scripts. Whether you're calculating the factorial of a trans-dimensional integer or finding the greatest common divisor between stellar masses, the syntax is designed for intuitive interaction.</p>
            <pre><code>
# Example: Activating PyMath's factorial computation core
from pymath.lib.math import factorial

# Calculate the factorial of 7 (a mystical number in many galaxies)
result = factorial(7)
print(f"The factorial resonance is: {result}") # Output: The factorial resonance is: 5040

# Example: Charting a Fibonacci sequence
from pymath.lib.math import fibonacci

# Determine the 10th element in a Fibonacci sequence
fib_number = fibonacci(10)
print(f"The 10th Fibonacci marker is: {fib_number}") # Output: The 10th Fibonacci marker is: 34
